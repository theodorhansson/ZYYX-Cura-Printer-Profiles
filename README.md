# ZYYX profiles for CURA
## We've been trying to reach you regarding your printer's extended warranty

These profiles were developed (with permission) from ZYYX's own profiles for CURA and Simplify3D. Awaiting merge, these can be installed to your own computer using the instructions below.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Install CURA using the installer from their site.
2. Download the profiles from this repository from the page ''Releases''.
3. Find your the location of your CURA install. This will be in the folder ''Program Files/Ultimaker Cura X.Y/share/cura/resources'' where you will extract the contents of this repository.

### Mac and Linux

I don't know how to do this. Feel free to contact me to update the instructions.
